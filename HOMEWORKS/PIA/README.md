# Cake Shop Inventory

_The objective of this project is to create a database of the stock of the raw materials the user has_

## Idea of Program 

Register the materials, their amount and price

Print the list of the materials introduced

Print the inventory value 

# Plan
* **Menu**: in this section you will find 6 options, 
- Product Registration [1]
- Print data of only one product [2]
- Print all the products introduced [3]
- Print the inventory value of only one product  [5]
- Print the total inventory value [5]
- Exit [6]

* **[1]Product Registration**: in this option you're asked to enter the name, amount and cost of the product
* **[2]Print a product**: is needed to introduce a code that was automatically generated.
* **[3]Print all products**: only pulse the option needed, in this case 3.
* **[4]Print inventory**: this option works the same as option 2, this will printout the result of an operation (cn*c).
* **[5]Print total inventory**: as in option 3 it is only necessary to type the # of option, 5.
* **[6]Exit**: the program will stop

#### Autoevaluation
1: complexity 2 (not so complex but not so easy)
2: functionality 3 (sometimes the order of how the options are selected causes the execution to finish)
3: code 3 (it's very neat)
4: storage 3 (adjusts to the ones you occupy)
5: documentation 1 (video has not the best quality)
Final Score 12/15
